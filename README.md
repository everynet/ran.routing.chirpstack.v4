# Everynet RAN to ChirpStack Bridge

It is an early stage beta product. Please refer to the known limitations section.

## Introduction

Everynet operates a Neutral-Host Cloud RAN, which is agnostic to the LoRaWAN Network Server. Everynet's main product is carrier-grade coverage that can be connected to any LNS available on the market and ChirpStack in particular.

Everynet coverage is available via Everynet RAN Routing API that let customers control message routing table (subscribe to devices). It also allows to send and receive LoRaWAN messages.

This integration is designed to simplify the connection between the Everynet RAN Routing API and ChirpStack installation. 

## Functionality 

With this software, you can connect your [ChirpStack Application]([https://www.chirpstack.io/application-server/use/applications/]) to Everynet RAN coverage.

Before we start it is important to mention that Everynet RAN main functionality is LoRaWAN traffic routing, while ChirpStack is doing the rest of the job: device and key management, payload parsing and so on...

**Everynet RAN does not store any device-related cryptographic keys and is not capable of decrypting customer traffic.** 


## How it works

This software works similar to the standard ChirpStack gateway bridge component which receives packets from real gateways.

Everynet RAN to ChirpStack bridge receives messages from RAN Routing API and translates it to a virtual gateway messages that are then served to the ChirpStack installation.

The integration periodically fetches devices from the ChirpStack API and add these device to the Everynet RAN routing table (subscribe to these devices).


## Configuration

Before using this software you should configure the following parameters. Make sure that you correctly set all the required parameters.

Parameters are read from environment variables and/or **settings.cfg** and **.env** files.

## Deploying ChirpStack and Ran-Bridge with docker-compose

For now it is only possible to deploy this bridge using docker and docker-compose.
If you don't have any installation of ChirpStack first you need to deploy it. For reference you can use docker-compose files from this repository.

### 1. Build chirpstack-ran-bridge docker image
```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.chirpstack.yml -f docker-compose.chirpstack-ran-bridge.yml build
```

### 2. Start chirpstack.
```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.chirpstack.yml up -d
```

### 3. Configure tenant_id

Decide required tenant id. You can find this id in chirpstack UI, or use utility script:

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.chirpstack.yml -f docker-compose.chirpstack-ran-bridge.yml \
    run chirpstack-ran-bridge python query-tenants.py
```

Select tenant and copy it's `tenant id` value into `.env` file as `CHIRPSTACK_TENANT_ID` variable. Ensure this tenant can have gateways.

<details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

```
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.chirpstack.yml -f docker-compose.chirpstack-ran-bridge.yml \    
    run chirpstack-ran-bridge python query-tenants.py

|     name     |                tenant id                |  can have gateways  |
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
|  ChirpStack  |  52f14cd4-c6f1-4fbd-8f87-4025e1d49242   |         yes         |

```
</details>

### 4. Create Chirpstack API token

You can create api-token manually under "api-keys" section of chirpstack UI, or use utility script:

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.chirpstack.yml -f docker-compose.chirpstack-ran-bridge.yml \
    run chirpstack-ran-bridge python create-token.py
```

<details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

```
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.chirpstack.yml -f docker-compose.chirpstack-ran-bridge.yml \
    run chirpstack-ran-bridge python create-token.py

CHIRPSTACK_API_TOKEN="eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJhdWQiOi<...>CI6ImtleSJ9.HF2DwQL9jgUyXG0e5TfgvHpUteguSapeSsIvppIfRDE"

```
</details>

Set `CHIRPSTACK_API_TOKEN` variable with obtained token in .env file.

If you want to create non-admin access token for your ran-bridge installation, you can generate token only for desired tenant.

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.chirpstack.yml -f docker-compose.chirpstack-ran-bridge.yml \
    run chirpstack-ran-bridge python create-token.py --tenant-id 52f14cd4-c6f1-4fbd-8f87-4025e1d49242 --not-admin
```

In this case provide "--tenant-id" flag with same tenant_id, you set as .env variable `CHIRPSTACK_TENANT_ID` on step 3.

### 5. Create gateway

You need to create new gateway in ChirpStack. You can do it under "tenant/gateways" section of UI, or use utility script:

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.chirpstack.yml -f docker-compose.chirpstack-ran-bridge.yml \
    run chirpstack-ran-bridge python create-gateway.py --gateway-id 000000000000c0de --tenant-id 52f14cd4-c6f1-4fbd-8f87-4025e1d49242
```

<details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

```
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.chirpstack.yml -f docker-compose.chirpstack-ran-bridge.yml \
    run chirpstack-ran-bridge python create-gateway.py --gateway-id 000000000000c0de --tenant-id 52f14cd4-c6f1-4fbd-8f87-4025e1d49242

CHIRPSTACK_GATEWAY_ID="000000000000c0de"

```
</details>

Provide "--tenant-id" flag with same tenant_id, you set as .env variable `CHIRPSTACK_TENANT_ID` on step 3.

Set `CHIRPSTACK_GATEWAY_ID` variable with identifier of created gateway in .env file.


### 6. Configure Access to RAN

Edit .env file and set your RAN token in `RAN_TOKEN` variable and api URL in `RAN_API_URL` variable.
You can obtain this values from RAN cloud UI.

### 7. Start chirpstack-ran-bridge

On this step, your `.env` file must contain several required values, example:

```env
CHIRPSTACK_TENANT_ID="52f14cd4-c6f1-4fbd-8f87-4025e1d49242"
CHIRPSTACK_API_TOKEN="<...>"
CHIRPSTACK_GATEWAY_ID="000000000000c0de"
RAN_TOKEN="<...>"
RAN_API_URL="https://dev.cloud.everynet.io/api/v1"
```

Now, you can run configured RAN-bridge.

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.chirpstack.yml -f docker-compose.chirpstack-ran-bridge.yml up -d
```

Chirpstack with ran-chirpstack-bridge will be available at `http://<YOUR DOMAIN>:8080`


## Known limitations

These are the known limitations that are going to be fixed in the next versions of this software:

- neither FSK, nor LR-FHSS modulations are supported
